*1 - Customer Initialization
```yaml
  1.We are going to write a software to perform an online shopping application called Z-Kart.
  2.The back bone for every online retail application is its customers. The initial customer details for our system will be given in a file zusers_db.txt
  3.The file contains multiple lines and every line will be of the form

  2.The inventory of Z-Kart is initialized from the file z-kart_db.txt which is of below format
  
  Category Brand Model Price Stock

 Mobile Motorola G 12000 5
 Laptop HP Elite 56000 20
 Tablet Google ChromeBook 8000 12


```

*2 - 3 - New Account Signups
```yaml
 1.There must be provision to sign up new accounts. While adding new customers, get their e-mail id, name, mobile number and password as input. Ask the user to       re-type password to avoid any typos. Ensure that the password and re-typed password match.
 2.Since every customer needs to be identified uniquely, ensure that the given e-mail id is not existing in our registered Z-Kart database. If so, prompt the user     to sign in instead of sign up
 3.Append the newly added customer details into the zusers_db.txt
